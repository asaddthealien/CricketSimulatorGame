# CricketSimulatorGame

**What is the Project?**
Our project is a turn based, 2 players, **cricket game simulation made using C** programming language.


**What does it do?**
The program takes the input from both the players but keeps the input hidden from each other. If both inputs are same, a wicket is counted. If the inputs are different, the score in added in batsman tally.
 

**Why did we choose it?**
Reason for choosing this project was: It is interactive, and we also have real life experience of playing this game. Another reason was that the program also uses many programming concepts that we have learnt in our classes.
